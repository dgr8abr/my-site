I"Ê<p>Good day, 
Welcome to my website and I appreciate you visiting my blog,
If you‚Äôre reading this, then maybe you knew me before or perhaps we met once or twice somewhere or you‚Äôre a total stranger who just happened to click on one of my profiles online
. <br />
I will try to keep my blogs short, more or less 500 words as people nowadays have an attention span of a cat, and just so you know, I am not a professional writer that can think of so many ideas to write, but I believe that I can write, I‚Äôm just not a good writer. .LOL. 
Now, what‚Äôs the point why I started writing this blog?  People write for different reasons, Mesopotamians back in the day, who were the early inhabitants of the modern day Iraq and Syria were believed to be the one who came up with the first forms of writing, they started writing for the purpose of keeping an accounting record of how many grains a farmer has placed in a granary, so that they‚Äôll have an idea on how much to pay to those farmers. But for me, my purpose is to express my thoughts in this simplest, archaic way possible, that I can be someone like Marcus Aurelius , Socrates thru Plato, and ofcourse, our own Philippines revered national hero Jose Rizal, who wrote not just to educate, but to kindle people‚Äôs philosophy &amp; patriotism and to inspired us think critically and to take action not just in their homeland but everyone who happened to study their lives &amp; read few of their works. On top of that, every time I write, I feel like all the ugly and bad things that‚Äôs surrounds me, dissipate like a smoke and every time I finished writing my ideas and thoughts, I feel like I‚Äôm Jack Dawson yelling ‚ÄúI AM THE KING OF THE WORLD‚Äù, so I think it‚Äôs one of those things that purges some of my repressed emotions out, so it‚Äôs like a form of catharsis for someone like me,  I also wanted to hone my writing skills and become an effective writer as I once dreamed to be a columnist, even though I don‚Äôt have the credentials to make me become one, still I dream to become someone someday. One thing that also enamored me to writing is that you won‚Äôt have to be really good at it or you need to give it some time to learn it, you just need a paper and a pen or a cheap computer to start doing it, you just let the thoughts flow. Initially, the idea of writing didn‚Äôt spark any interest to me at all, the inception of this idea came out in the mid-2020, when the COVID-19 pandemic was in its early days that it brought so much destruction everywhere in the world and in every aspect to a person‚Äôs life,  that it changed our ways of thinking 2020 and beyond,  But by the time you‚Äôre reading this, it‚Äôs a good news that COVID-19 is not that widespread anymore, I thank God for all those scientists who worked tirelessly to look for a panacea and I‚Äôm not discounting the wonders of the vaccines that were administered to nearly 1/3 of the Filipino populace.
The blog posts that I will publish here will all be opinion-based but all of it will be backed by facts, such as the dates, the names , the concepts and etc, so I‚Äôll just wrap this post like a KISS meaning I‚Äôll just KEEP IT SHORT AND SIMPLE as a former colleague in my work say as he prefers to talk less when he‚Äôs talking to a client over the phone. So please visit this site once or a while to be updated for all of my future blogs, because I will write once or twice per week, every Sunday and Wednesday to let everyone know about my opinions and thoughts about some important issues that I‚Äôm passionate about, that includes politics, history, business and social issues that affects the populace in this benighted land.</p>

<p>#1 : So, what‚Äôs the point ?<br />
