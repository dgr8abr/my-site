This is a sales-related post, now if you’re not a salesperson don’t even bother reading. No, I was just kidding.  Well, I’ll make sure that you’ll acquire something valuable from this article that you can apply in your life and in your work. 

What is sales exactly?  What differentiates the apex salespeople from the average ones?  

And how can you develop and nurture the inner salesman inside to be good in the field of persuasion and influence.

Well for me, Sales is not just merely convincing the other person to purchase whatever you’re selling.  But it’s the successful channeling of an emotion to another person or entity.  In psychology, there are at least 27 emotions that are known to man. And with sales, only one is needed and that is certainty.

I still remember the first day when I first got a sales related job.  My first sales job was dead simple, and that is to cold call numbers using a software that was data-fed with a lot of dataset that might contain a homeowner’s information.


and look for homeowners who might be interested in lowering their electric costs with solar and set them up for a solar appointment.. Now I wasn’t that much of an expert back in the day , it took me 6 or 7 months before I got a sale.



It all started 4 years ago, When I had to look for a different job that could pay me well because the pandemic that transpired, and I carefully weigh up my options. If I’m going to continue as a singer / musician or not. I can still work as a singer for a band while playing in a studio and not in a bar, but Hey the pandemic showed me to think differently and that is to view the world from a different trade that might be beneficial for my career.

I’m passionate about showing people a different perspective on things, that’s why I got into sales	

 Well, same question that separates ordinary athletes, artists or  players from the 

It is said that Kobe Bryant practices so much

I will curate all the ways on how I became an effective salesman that made me who I am today. 


The reason why I wanted a sales career is that I’ll be able to use my love for history and knowledge 


 so much is that you have the ability to change a person's life for the better or for the worse.

And also I think I’m only good in 3 things in life, Music, History and Selling aside from love-making.

Now, In my close to 3 years of experience in sales and marketing, I’ve learned a lot of things and I 

I still believe that cold calling and telemarketing is still marketing.  As your goal is to get people to be part of your potential prospects. 

To always use a script whenever you’re calling





 
People buy for two reasons. First is because they love a product, and second, if it solves a problem.



1. Building Rapport
2. Tonality Patterns
3. Paradigm Shift
4. Active Listening
5. Objection Handling


Building Rapport 

	In the context of cold calling, building good rapport is of the essence.

 - Rapport is very important in sales.  Rapport is a good sense of understanding and trust. If you have good rapport with your neighbors, they won't mind if you kick your ball onto their property every now and then.  IT makes them feel that you’re part of the family




Bruce Lee once said : “I fear not the man who has practiced 10,000 kicks once, but I fear the man who has practiced one kick 10,000 times.
”. 

A great man practices 

So you have to drill this in your brain all day to be extremely good at handling objections. Practice makes perfect.


Tonality Patterns

Absolute Certainty
Utter Sincerity
Reasonable Man => Sound fair enough?
4.  Implied Obviousness


Have you ever wondered why some people are just good at making people engaged?

Why some people are more charismatic than others? 

The secret is with their body language and tonality.  So body language and tonality is the secret sauce of influence 

Unconscious mind => Unlimited processing power, it controls our heartbeat, 

	


 “The voice is a deep reflection of character, of who we are—the voice is the fingerprint of the soul.”

In psychology, the mind consists of subconscious and conscious part : 
So to influence people and catch their attention, we need to hijack the subconscious mind in order to get the full attention of the person.
 So, how do we do this?

People may listen to your words, but they react to your tone.  See our conscious mind => has limited processing power, 


II. The Subconscious Mind Now, what is our subconscious? Our subconscious though remains predominantly beyond the reach of our conscious mind, many of our mind’s activities are processed in subconscious. And we, sometimes, get projection of it through intuition or sudden retrieval of a memory; or through dreams into our consciousness. We become tired to solve some problem, suddenly solution comes to our mind in some relaxed moment or when away from thinking about it. It means that subconscious was working on it all the time. So, it functions as a backstage to our conscious mind where many of our conscious activities are rehearsed, evaluated, processed and finalized for actions like – storage in long-term memory, or projection into our consciousness through different ways. So, we may call it sub-conscious mind

Watch me read 



Objection Handling

1. Using quotes and biographies and life lessons from famous people like : Colonel Sanders and 

2  Analogy

3. Use stories from previous customers or you can create a story of your own.
4. Look for things that you agree on with.






Objections are normal part of the sales and marketing process. It allows the customer to express their current situation, and vent out their frustrations and prior experiences that relates to the product you’re offering them. 

I will write my response to all the objections that were posted on [Mailshake’s][mailshake-link] blog. 

As a general rule, an objection is a telltale sign that the customer doesn’t trust you. But note that there are also objections that just needs clarifications.

In a nutshell, you have to make sure that the customer will not throw an objection at you, cause this means they don’t believe in whatever you’re saying or they simply don’t trust you.

So you make sure you build a good rapport first.  Now, refer to my building a good rapport blog[mailshake-link] on how you can ensure that you’ve created a good rapport.

So, I will be writing my response to these objections relate this down in the context of solar, cause that’s the niche where I had the experience of working.
 The secret to influence is thru tonality and body language, if you want to influence someone  

 	

And also remember: End the objection’s rebuttal with a question, cause by doing so the conversation will flow continuously.  For example when you were a kid, if you want to learn to talk to your elders, you usually 

But remember when you’re cold-calling, it’s always good to remember this belief : Some do, some don’t, so what? So don’t beat yourself up

It’s not the words but how you say it.  So, tonality is a big game changer when it comes to cold calling. 

Note that some objections may fall into several objection types, it’s just a matter of the current customer’s current dilemma. 






Now I will post an audio sample.


Empathy

## Peace of Mind Objections

- The secret to overcoming peace of mind objections is to build a good rapport. Now I will link the audio below employing proper tonality to each of them.  

 - So these are objections that makes customer just want to have a peace of mind during the presentation.   Objections like these means that you need to educate them about the product 



 => “You Have a Bad Review.”
=> 
	




I NEED TO TALK TO MY SPOUSE




2. Go Away Objections
Now, the secret to winning a go away objection is how you would calm down the customer.  The right words + the right tonality will make you a success.





“Not Interested”
“I’m in a meeting”
They are objections that -
I’m in  a meeting


11. “Where the Hell Did You Get My Name?!”



>  “Now’s Not a Good Time / I'm too busy right now / I’m in a meeting”
 
When a customer throws you with this objection.  It’s either you caught them at a bad time or they don’t trust you that much so they want to get you off the phone sooner than later.  The good part about this objection when you’re cold calling, you can win over them without them seeing you. Even if you’re wearing your pajamas

So, you have to make sure that you always win after an objection comes out, by giving them a choice and make sure that the ball is in your court.

By responding with this line : 

“Well, _____,   I can be brief or I can call you back later, which works best for u?”
 You give them two options that make sure that they will answer that puts ball on your court. 

If they say like : 
“yeah you can be brief”, then you have the chance to continue with your sales presentation in 1 or couple  minutes

Cool, _____________, Sure i’ll keep it really quick. The thing here is then you can<insert the unique selling proposition that your company/product offers here> 
With relevance to solar . American homeowners can now go solar and reap all the benefits of it without paying anything upfront not like before wherein they have to shove huge money 
you can now easily get solar with no upfront cost, that’s 0$ down but not everyone gets approved for this, so do you know how much do u pay for ur electricity/month ? And then you can continue asking with your prequalifying questions.
	


 Below is a recorded audio wherein I will try to explain to a customer.

> 2. Just send me the information


 > Misunderstanding Objections

=> They don’t understand the concept of the idea you’re explaining


1. A friend who’s a says that having it makes it harder to ………..


> Price / Cost Objections.

NOTHING’s FREE
It’s too expensive
	- You give them two options that makes sure that the ball is in your court.
	=> The thing about this too expensive is that 

You have two options. 

3. I don’t have the budget


 Below is a recorded audio wherein I will try to explain to a customer.


> Hidden Objections

1.  “I’m Not Ready to Commit.”


I’ve had a family emergency, I want to cancel my appointment. 
I don’t like you.
3. “I don’t have intention to buy, but…”

13. “I Don’t See the Value.”





MAKE SURE THAT THE BALL IS ALWAYS IN YOUR COURT








 
	
3. “I’m Already in Another Contract.”


6. “I Need to Run This Past My Boss.”
7. “Product X is Cheaper.”
8. “You Don’t Offer Feature X.”
