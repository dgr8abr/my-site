I just miss the wordpress style of publishing blogs, but luckily Netlify is around to help me publish this site flawlessly, I don't wanna lie to people but I had some issues with Wordpress , thankfully I had some web development background, now I can blog anywhere thanks to Netlify.  But surely I'll be migrating all my content to wordpress.
