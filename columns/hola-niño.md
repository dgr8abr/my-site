# **Hola Niño**

Is this the real life ? Is this just fantasy ? Caught up in a landslide....... Look in the sky and see,  a rainy El Niño season ? 

Earlier this month, news outlets informed the public that El Niño **has already come** but why is it we see flooding everywhere in the countryside, urban and suburban areas? Maybe It’s not just El Niño Vodka but with a twist of Climate Change Martini, perhaps?  


This has got to be one of those first experiences in our lifetime to experience a rainy El Niño season, Pretty much the same with my aunt who’s in her 70s already, to see an onion with such an oddly hefty increase in price last year or was it several months ago? 

Is this another one of those fake news? But this time from someone we expect to be credible our very own weather agency, PAG-ASA? I hope not.


El Niño should be dry and humid. But why is it raining all day ? 

The answer is NO, this is not going to be the first time, in fact El Niño season usually commences with rains pouring in its early phase.  Therefore, farmers and non-farmers alike should take advantage of the heavy rains to store any rainwater we could manage to store to combat moderate to strong El Niño drought in the coming months.   Farmers can build water ponds or set up water-collecting drums too.   Aside from the drought, I think it is the best time for this insensitive government to take a look @ the heavy floods we see everywhere in the country, a tangible problem to work with if it wants to epitomize its Bagong Pilipinas brand, as for too long, floods had been a major problem that chafed my head from scratching, from slow traffic that can dwindle our economic growth to life threatening illnesses, no matter what, this problem must be solved as soon as possible. 


I hope our politicians will always prioritize it’s people’s welfare first, instead of filling their pockets with whatever they could get their hands on, especially the flood-control projects that can’t control floods, sub-standard roads and bridges, culverts that’s for sure, wasted projects because of its unreliability in the long run.  How can we Love the Philippines if it’s this unlovable?  Maybe they were referring to the kind of love that the Bible says, love is patient, love is kind, it does not bring dishonor and all the rest, but I am writing this because I love the Philippines,  not because I love the government that’s currently running it.  And that’s how our government preys on us, our predominantly Catholic / Christian upbringing makes us susceptible to endure hardships than to complain and take action, as it is ingrained in our psyche to live a modest life, free from luxuries, humility, have patience, and that’s a tool the government uses to take advantage of us, that’s the same reason why Rizal was so enthralled to join the Freemasonry movement back then, not because he abhorred Catholic’s teachings but the leaders behind it who took advantage of its teachings to abuse others, mostly the prayles, for the state and the church were one before.  Unlike the type of love that the romantic French had who always took their frustrations out in the streets of France expressing their dissatisfaction towards the bare minimums in society like unfair wages, adjusting the retirement age.  That’s the kind of love that I admire, the one that don’t repress.  For silence is the voice of the oppressed.



But, there’s a program that this current administration initiated which fascinated me. Not too long ago, I saw the commencement of DSWD’s Walang Gutom 2023: Food Provision through Strategic Transfer and Alternative Measures Program (Food Stamp Program) in Facebook which was attended by PBBM and VP Sara themselves and I think this program is really remarkable, as it uses food credits instead of cash to subsidize low-income Filipino families, They could then use the credits to buy select food items from DSWD-registered or accredited retailers, food that can transform into energy that can help people land a job and be part of the Filipino workforce. Why do I love this program? because we all know that money can be used in impractical things like gambling, or even buying illegal drugs.  Beneficiaries of the program will be required to attend capacity building and development training, as well as become part of the labor workforce. "We may look at the Food Stamp [Program] as a temporary solution... If their energy is low, they cannot work. The goal here is to help them start in the span of three or four years that they will be part of the program, eat right so they can find enough energy to be part of nation-building," the DSWD secretary said. "When the person has found a job, then he can leave such a program, then we have done our job already."


In my opinion, What the agency did was actually very effective in supporting nation building in the post COVID-19 era, it was meant to address Maslow’s most basic human survival need, Food. As Erap said: A hungry stomach knows no law, so if you want to solve most of society’s problems; make food accessible and affordable to all, which led me to think of the current administration’s approach in addressing inflation, an issue that affects every Filipino, now and then, How can the government report to the general public that it was able to curb out inflation when I went to a convenience store few weeks ago and still paid the same amount for a product that I paid couple months ago?.  What I want is a growth that’s inclusive, something that can be felt by everyone. Not just an esoteric statement from economists. However you may look at it, this current administration has still got so many rooms for improvement, especially in handling inflation and delivering factual news. 


I pray and hope our economy will get better in time, just like this current El Nino we’re facing, after all this clouds and rains, sun and warmer days are just ahead.
