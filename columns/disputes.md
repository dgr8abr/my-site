# 4 -  DISPUTES

The harassment suffered by a Filipino fisherman interviewed in the evening news last night from the hands of a Chinese vessel is something that we Filipinos should not take for granted. This skirmish is alarming that it led me to write another political column.

In times like these, we should show that the Bayanihan spirit is at least possible towards our poor Filipino fishermen in the disputed waters of South China Sea. 

“Bayanihan” — a Filipino trait that was taught in school when we were kids; wherein it would depict a band of people bringing a hut, and moving it to a different place showing our Filipino solidarity towards our neighbor.  But what can we do to help the poor fisherman near the disputed waters, if it is indeed nearer to the Philippines compared to China.

Why don’t we join together, for our hapless fishermen? Where is the Bayanihan spirit that was inculcated to us when we were kids? If bayanihan was indeed in our veins, we as fellow Filipinos, should at least organize a protest in front of the Chinese embassy and burn effigies to show our vexation towards these imperialistic conduct of the Chinese government. 

Signs of the economic times perhaps, people would rather stay in their homes and tackle their issues, either personal or family, rather than join or organize a rally.

And we as a nation, afraid of the repercussions that will happen, either economic or civil, will just outweigh the courage in our hearts. Unlike the willful Vietnamese who loots and burns Chinese owned buildings in Vietnam.  Why don’t we imitate the Vietnamese them were so brave and patriotic that they would burn and loot the Chinese owned buildings in Vietnam? But I won’t suggest doing that as it’s pure lawlessness.

We, as citizens of this country, have to use our voice to be heard. But then again, China is a different animal, harassment and bullying is part of their game plan to occupy more islands.  But we still hope and pray that China would mend their ways and respect international laws as it is the foundation of a civilized world.  I hope one day, we’ll find the justice we really deserved as a small developing country.   

Especially now that we need to have access to nutritious seafood such as fish to sustain our bodies in the post-pandemic times. I hope China would show humanity towards their neighbors in the South China Sea, so that there will be lasting peace in the foreseeable future.

Wars, due to territorial expansion, has been a major source of conflicts ever since. More powerful countries do this for national security and greater access to food and natural resources.

Concerning wars, as I write, the hot potato is still the conflict between Israel and the militant group, Hamas. Hamas, the Palestinian militant group controlling the Gaza Strip near the Israeli border had launched a coordinated land, sea, and air assault that took Israel by surprise this weekend, October 7 that had resulted to deaths of 3 Filipinos. Currently, Hamas had taken hostage an estimated 150 people from Israel including women, children and older adults as well as numerous U.S. and Thai citizens, vowing to kill one hostage every time an Israeli airstrike hits Gazans “in their homes without warning.”

We pray that all of these conflicts will end soon as there are no real winners in a war, especially the ones that don’t care about politics: the children, the sick and the have-nots; therefore, UN and its peace negotiators must intervene and move quickly to draft a quick resolution to ensure fairness is possible on both sides.

But as an adage goes: “There can be no peace without war”. What if Hitler and his ideologies weren’t defeated? A war must be won to attain peace. The good must defeat the evil, and in my viewpoint, Hamas represents the evil, for if you abduct and hostage children and old people because you have no tolerance against people from a different race or religion, then you are not human, you are an extremist. Why would you not recognize Israel, if the leaders back then approved of a reinstatement of a Jewish state after WW2?.  If there was indeed an occupation that Israel did to the Palestinians, then they should blame the World leaders back then who used the Bible as one of its reference for creation of the state of Israel. What Hamas was doing is an insult to the Christians, that’s why designating them as terrorists would be appropriate. 

Taking hostages such as innocent civilians especially kids is just purely barbaric. Why do of all people, the innocent kids had to endure all the sufferings that our politicians and leaders commit?  If the Hamas militants are indeed fighters for freedom, why strip the innocent children of freedom, just for the sake of retaliation?

Speaking of children, I happened to visit my former school in Cebu City, few weeks ago and as I walked on the sidewalks outside. I saw how the pandemic pauperized the lower class since multiple families together with their kids are sleeping in the sidewalks while some of the children were playing. Can our leaders mend their ways, give these people a decent housing to live in and bring back their dignity in life?. Isn’t it their duty to help these kids, nourish their frail bodies and prepare them for school, as they are the future of this country?.

At present, the Vice President is facing issues with regards to her “confidential funds”, making it the latest buzzword in national politics since the Vice President’s detractors and few lawmakers who stripped her of it for alleged malversation.

Our local leaders should’ve prioritized funding the basics such as education, health or housing instead of allocating money for confidential funds or the unconstitutional pork cuts that our lawmakers can collect from time to time; thus, politicizing this early by financing demolition jobs against the Vice President won’t be beneficial for the ordinary Juan De La Cruz, as the rift between both institutions just slows everything down that it'll just make our leaders forget the real score on the ground and that is serving the public, especially now that we need to recuperate from the effects of the pandemic to our economy.

Let’s not forget that, before we vote for our Barangay and SK Officers come October 30. May the 1.2 Million candidates who filed their COC’s to be compassionate enough to represent the downtrodden in the 42,000 barangays they’re vying for.
