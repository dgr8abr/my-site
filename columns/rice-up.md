# #3 **RICE UP**

### - THIS ARTICLE SHOULD've BEEN PUBLISHED AUGUST 28, 2023.




With the current prices of rice inching up again recently, I can’t help but to write my thoughts out again. So that I can share my two cents about this pressing matter that concerns majority of Filipinos in this post-pandemic time. For sharing is caring, my friends. 

Last month, the President delivered his 2nd annual State of the Nation Address inside the Batasang Pambansa. Many attended the occasion as the President announced his achievements this past year and his goals for the next in front of the joint session of Congress.

In a speech that lasted an hour and 11 minutes long, he first rattled a 7.6% economic growth in 2022, the highest in 46 years. He boasted that the country is among the fastest-growing economies in Asia and the world. 

With strong macro-economic fundamentals, he also claimed partial victory over the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. While recognizing inflation as the biggest devil, not just an elephant in the room that he needed to tackle. 

As a result, he threatened individuals who are driving up the prices of basic goods. Then, he pushed the Congress to approve a fresh list of measures to combat this. 

Despite the economic growth that the president claimed. With the current economic woes, it is no surprise that the price of rice has already inched up to 45-50 pesos/ kilo, a 10% higher than when former President Duterte’s term ended last year, so we should expect that it won’t go down, whether it’s in the palengke or in the supermarket. 

If the current numbers will continue, we would be looking at 50-56/kilo by Christmas or early next year. Far cry from the 20/kilo of rice that the proud 31 million voting force expected to receive. And they should be expecting something, since the president is the concurrent agriculture chief.

From an economist’s perspective, at 6-7 percent growth rates. With inflation running around at 5-7 percent. We still haven’t bounced back to pre-pandemic levels yet. But at 10 percent annually, from 2023 to 2028. And if we could get the GDP growing to around 40 trillion per annum, we can recover. It’s doable but a very difficult feat to achieve. Given the fact that I don’t see any bold reforms that this administration embarked for the past year. 

Maybe paring the pork that our legislators might pocket from every projects accomplished in their areas of concerns is a huge step. And after that return them back to the national treasury once the projects are completely finished, it would help our economy come to full circle back to pre-pandemic time. And let’s not forget about transparency in those transactions, it should not take the backseat. 

But, in my viewpoint, if someone wants to win the next elections. One must be able to consolidate and maintain power, without the politicians backing your candidacy, one cannot simply win, so, to win the elections you need to feed those politicians with money, which is why I think it’s so difficult to address the problem of vote buying in this country, for it’s been the lay of the land in this country ever since. The long and short of it, it’s hard to believe him, when he said that he would not tolerate corruption or incompetence in his government, being in front of an audience that benefited from the pork cuts that Mayor Magalong divulged to the media last month.

Aside from being bold by trimming the pork, the president should also make sure that there’s urgency in his affairs as looking at our public debt that’s now inched up to 14.1 trillion PESOS, consisting 63% of our GDP will make him scratch his head even more. Even though our economic managers don’t want us to worry as 63 percent is still lower than US or Japan’s debt to GDP ratio. We shouldn’t compare ourselves to those countries as those countries have higher HDI’s and overall economic numbers.

But urgency without planning won’t be better for anyone. So devising a plan with concrete actions should be the priority of any leader who plans to boost its country’s efforts in this post-pandemic era.

The failure of the Pinklawans and the Yellow clique to provide us a sound government system caused 31 million of us choose another Marcos.  A member of a family that Filipinos had already overthrown 40 years ago through a historic peaceful revolution.  Is this the way we look at our elected officials?  A biodegradable trash that we keep recycling them ? No wonder we keep suffering from the same story of inefficiency and corruption; it’s because of this particular mindset.

Which led me to think of what transpired 40 years after Ninoy Aquino’s death. When we replaced an autocratic government with a democracy that promised to us freedom, only to allow the creation of the few nouveau riche. Citing the likes of Janet Lim Napoles and the few government officials who were charged with graft cases but still managed to get elected back again to public office.  In my viewpoint, too much of that freedom made people complacent about discipline and the way our government led made corruption possible because of this freedom, For the Philippines : we should be more certain with our rules ; we should be able to mix liberal and stern policies for it to be better and therefore, my standard for voting a leader is someone that can provide me a mix to that type of cocktail.

Meanwhile, for devout Catholics, August 28 is a date worth noting, as it is the feast day of St. Augustine, the patron saint for brewers, a notable figure in the church, and for me a role model for all truth-seekers in this world, a famous saint who was a renowned convert, who once was lived a life of pure freedom beguiled with worldly pleasures; seeking the truth only to find himself truth in finding God. May he be an inspiration to us Filipinos who are trying to seek truth in this post-truth world; to be a better Christian and to be able to realize our full potential as an individual.

On the local scene, FIBA World Cup 2023 has already commenced last week or was that few days ago? But, as expected, Philippines didn’t win a single game in its last 3 outings.  After all, basketball is a game for the giants but that player from Angola managed to get my attention, at only 5’6, guy was the top scorer for Angola for quite some time which made me change my mind about basketball. Height might help a player make points but it’s one’s determination and dedication to win will make a difference in the game.

On the international scene, the death of Yevgeny Prigozhin has sent waves of shock and horror to people around the world. Prigozhin, the former Wagner group leader died in a plane crash last week at the age of 62. For those who don’t know the man, he was the one who led an uprising against Putin two months ago. It then ceased after the President of Belarus brokered an agreement between Putin and the Wagner group leader, few hours after Prigozhin brought down a dozen Russian plane. Vladimir Putin consider Prigozhin as a traitor after this incident. 

Furthermore, the death of Prigozhin and the ongoing war in Europe will surely impact us here in the Philippines, especially the cash-strapped who's trying to make ends meet each day. As the price of basic commodities continue to rise due to the inevitable economic sanctions and the repercussions that will accumulate from this ongoing war.  

With it being said, I made a play about this current problem of prices of rice inching up again lately. For I can’t help but to write again to propose a solution on how we can solve this problem. Adding to the fact that India, which exports 40 percent of the world’s thin rice trade has banned exports of long grain and broken rice, along with wheat, to ensure domestic food security which would mean more price increases in the next few months. In my viewpoint, One way to solve this is for DA to promote cheaper alternatives to white milled rice, the proposal of Iloilo Congressman Garin few months ago seem to fit the bill as consuming more of our own farm or home grown camotes or I would like to add our local bugas mais (corn rice) as our alternative food source is practical.  Aside from that it’s cheaper and accessible, those two are also healthier than white rice. 


Then again, for the poor, Carbo-loading is the sole recourse to puzzle out hunger, as viands are expensive. While the nescient poor, without knowing that too much of carbohydrates in the body and not metabolizing it with exercise can impair our brain function, making us forget things easily and worse, increasing our risk of getting diabetes, stroke and heart disease.  Having said that, this current price increases in rice could be a blessing in disguise for us. As we can minimize our carbo-loading tendencies.  But for the ones who need carbs the most: the hardworking construction workers, or the indefatigable kargadors who just sweats the calories they get from rice. They need calories to perform better at work, as it helps them with their high calorie burning work but for the ones who are working without sweating that much:  like the office worker or the bank teller, eating too much rice might not be a good idea especially if one can’t do a strenuous exercise after eating it.

With the current prices of basic commodities like rice inching up again recently, It’s time for our leaders to rise up to the challenge. Enough talking, Urgency and Boldness is the key to win in these challenging times.
